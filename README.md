# BBestBot
## Back Story:
<p>Over a year, many sad customers did not receive the game system. The price started to rise. Customers blamed the store and Sony 
for not having enough to please everyone's needs. But Sony responded with a statement in condensed terms, basically saying because 
of being in a pandemic. The system can't be produced due to work limits, and materials to make the system are scarce. Families and 
people in the gaming community viewed this as a slap in the face. To make matters worst is that some people were able to get their 
hands on multiple PlayStation 5 at a time when the majority couldn't even get one. People saw this as a money-hungry opportunity. Since 
the console was new and everybody desired it, savage resellers decided to sell it to the people at a higher price, and sadly it worked. 
People who desperately needed a console were swindled to pay $800 - $1000. People like me decided to wait out the storm giving Sony 
another year to get production up and running correctly or until the entire world got back on its feet. The world opened up, yet the 
console never hit the store shelves. Sony ramped up production this time with a trick up their sleeves to cut off resellers and get 
back consumer interest. Sony gave stores like BestBuy, Target, and Walmart a limited supply that you can buy only online. It's been a 
year since the console was released, and you can't go into stores and buy it. Online releases are random, and no one has the time to check 
a link or website to see when the item is available. It's a first come, first serve scenario. So I made a bot.</p> 






## Thoughts Ideal Approaches:
(1) Some Twitter pages announce the days when certain companies restock the console by time and date.
(should we web scrape that profile for new release links and have a bot do the rest)

(2) Leave the website of the store open with a bot looking at eternal sources indicating restock due to backend, information wethers its database amount change or the HTML tag for the  buy button change from unviable to purchase or buy it now


## Issues Downsides:
(1)I think these companies monitor your IP address because once you attempt to run the bot multiple times a day. When it's time
to log in and finalize the purchase and your address. You are met with an error. This has nothing to do with the code but with 
the company eliminating spammers. This makes sense why higher-end bots use a proxy or VPN of some sort to network filter. 

(2)It has no GUI interface which means the user needs to know how to handle file changes to change an item of choice and apply 
credentials to log in and make the purchase. 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the bot as minimum as possible to avoid being blocked completely. At least 3 -5 times sporadically.</li>
  <li>Comments would be used to indicate where the user should input information.</li>
</ul>
